# etch-a-sketch

For this project, I am creating an Etch-a-Sketch game using Javascript DOM Manipulation. The game will allow users to create a new grid between size 1x1 and 100x100, clear art, and select between either a gray or continuous random colors. This is part of The Odin Project Curriculum.
